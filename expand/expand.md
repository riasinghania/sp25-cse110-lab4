1. *Asynchronous nature*:
   JavaScript often runs multiple operations at once. This can be confusing because code doesn't always execute in the order it's written. Developers might struggle with bugs caused by callbacks or promises that resolve too early or      too late.

    *Loose typing*:
    JavaScript doesn't enforce strict data types, this can cause unexpected behavior, like "2" + 2 resulting in "22" instead of 4. 

    *Web platform dependency*:
    Since JavaScript primarily runs in browsers, developers are at the mercy of the browser. It can be hard to write consistent code that works everywhere.

2. *Loosely typed*:
   I would assume the creators made it loosly typed to make it more beginner friendly because it is quicker to write and you don't need to worrying about declaring types. 

    *Asynchronous features*:
   By letting JavaScript run multiple operations at once JapvaScript can let the browser stay responsive and handle slow responses.

3. *Compiled language*:
   Code is translated into machine language before it's run. It's faster but less flexible during development.
  
   *Interpreted language*:
   Code is read and executed line by line by an interpreter. This allows quicker testing and flexibility but may run slower.

   JavaScript is interpreted.

    *Benefits of interpreted JS*:
    - Easier to debug and test changes on the fly
    - No need to recompile for small edits
  
    *Drawbacks*:
    - Potentially slower performance
    - More room for runtime errors
  
  4.   By using Vanilla JS first we are gaining a better understanding of how the language works and we can write cleaner code. Foundation helps you build up always. But a drawback of skipping framworks means we may miss out on using         industry tools. Also real life teas always use a framwork.
  5.   This lab teaches debugging, flow control, and code testing all essential to building a reliable project. In our own projetc we may use DevTools to track down errors, breakpoints to understand what variables are hanging, flow           charts for designing and so much more to make our proccess much smoother.
