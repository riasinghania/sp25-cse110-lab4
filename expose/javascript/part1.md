1. `values added: 20`

   Since add is true, the block inside the if statement is executed. The variable result is declared and then assigned 10 + 10 = 20, which is printed.
2. `final result: 20`

   Var has function scope, not block scope. Even though result is declared inside the if block, it is still accessible throughout the entire function. So line 13 can access result without an error.
3. You shouldn’t use var because it doesn’t stay inside the block where it’s defined. Instead, it’s visible everywhere in the function, which can cause problems if other parts of your code accidentally change it or use the same name. let and const are better because they only work where you define them, making your code easier to understand and avoid bugs.
4. `values added: 20`

   Since add is true, the code goes inside the if block, sets result = 10 + 10, and prints it. let works fine here because result is declared in this block and used within it.
5. `ReferenceError: result is not defined`

   This happens because let has block scope, meaning the variable result only exists inside the if block. Once that block ends, result is no longer accessible, so line 13 throws an error.
6. `TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.`

   Line 7 tries to change the value of result, but const variables cannot be reassigned after they’re initialized. Since result was set to 0 with const, trying to do result = num1 + num2 throws an error. So, line 9 is never reached, because the error occurs on line 7.
7. `ReferenceError: result is not defined`

   Because const (like let) is block-scoped, meaning result wouldn’t exist outside the if block.
